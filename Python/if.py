SOME NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------
Tabs and whitespace is REALLY important in Python
Remember you can't tab and preform 4 spaces in the same file in python. You'll get an error.

You'll get TabError: inconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation. 

You can avoid this error by overriding your text editor settings to change tabs to spaces.



TRUTH TERMS

<     [LESS THAN]

and 
or
